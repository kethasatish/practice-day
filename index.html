<p>Advanced JavaScript theory delves into the intricate details of how JavaScript works under the hood, understanding its design principles, and leveraging its advanced features for better programming practices. Hereâ€™s a deep dive into advanced JavaScript theory</p>

<p> Execution Context and Call Stack</p>
<p>An execution context is an abstract concept describing the environment within which JavaScript code is executed. Every time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack.</p>

<p>Global Execution Context: Created when the script first runs. It contains the global object (window in browsers), this, and any globally scoped variables or functions.
Function Execution Context: Created whenever a function is invoked. It has its own this, arguments, and local variables.</p>
<p>Call Stack: JavaScript uses a call stack to manage execution contexts. When a function is called, a new execution context is pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, the execution context is popped off the stack.

<img src="jason.jpg"alt="JASON API 1.10" width="200"height="220">

<p>It seems like you're referring to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation),</p><p> which is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a client over the web.</p><p> JSON is easy for humans to read and write, and it's also easy for machines to parse and generate.</p>

<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) that uses JSON for data exchange is often called a JSON API.</p><p> JSON APIs are popular because JSON can represent structured data such as arrays and objects, </p><p>making it versatile for transmitting various types of information.</p>

<p>JSON APIs are widely used in web development, particularly in RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer). </p><p>In a RESTful API, HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, and JSON is typically used to represent the data being sent or received in the HTTP requests and responses.</p>
